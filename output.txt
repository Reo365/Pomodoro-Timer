It seems that simply pushing again when your local repository is already up-to-date with the remote won't trigger a new deployment. Git will report "Everything up-to-date".

Deployment systems usually trigger when new changes (new commits) are pushed to a specific branch (like `main`).

Since I don't have access to your deployment setup or logs, I cannot directly resolve why the deployment failed. However, a common workaround to force a re-trigger of a deployment is to make a small, "dummy" commit and push it. This creates new changes that Git will then send to the remote, which *might* activate your deployment pipeline.

Would you like me to create a dummy commit and push it? Please confirm.
