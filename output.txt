I have completed the requested changes:
1. The theme switcher has been moved into the header on all pages.
2. The theme switcher is now present on all subpages (`about.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html`).
3. The active "Focus/Break" button color now changes with the selected theme.
I have modified `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html`, and `style.css`.
