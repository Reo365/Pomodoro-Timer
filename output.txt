The requested changes regarding the liquid glass effect on the Start/Reset buttons and their hover states, and the size mismatch of the Home/Language buttons, have been implemented in `style.css`.

Regarding the theme icons:
The icons' colors should already be adapting to the selected theme through the `fill: currentColor` property, which dynamically uses the `--c-content` CSS variable. If you meant that the *shape* of the icons should change based on the theme, this would require a JavaScript solution to swap out SVG paths, which is a more complex task. Please clarify if the current color adaptation is not what you expected.
