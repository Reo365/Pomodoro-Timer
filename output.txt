I have updated the animation for the "Focus/Break" mode indicator.

Due to the constraints of using only CSS and the way JavaScript dynamically controls the position and size of the mode indicator, directly replicating the `scaleToggle` animation (which involves a scaling effect) is not straightforward. The existing JavaScript code uses CSS `transition` for smooth movement.

To provide a similar dynamic and bouncy feel as the theme change buttons, I have modified the `transition`'s `cubic-bezier` timing function for the `.mode-indicator` to `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)`. This will make the indicator's movement more expressive and "bouncy" when switching between modes.

These changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository. Please check the live site to see the updated animation.
